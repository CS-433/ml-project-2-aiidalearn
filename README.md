## Project Description

This project aims at predicting both the energy accuracy and the simulation duration of a DFT simulation for a given set of input parameters and a prescribed chemical structure. Furthermore, we have implemented an approach to solve the inverse problem, i.e. to generate a set of computationally optimal input parameters for a prescribed chemical structure and energy accuracy.

This repository contains all the code used during the course of the project, including:
- scripts to prepare and launch DFT simulations on the EPFL cluster Fidis (Note that access credentials as well as computing time budget are required to launch them)
- scripts to parse the data from the JSON file and assemble it to the final raw dataset, i.e. with the chemical structures only given as strings
- scripts to assemble the final dataset for different encodings of the chemical structures. These datasets are not saved, but only assembled ad-hoc when they are needed. However, the data loading routines are factored out into a python model (see `code/tools/`), such that it is simple to retrieve them for other purposes.
- scripts to train our models
- notebooks to explore the data and analyse our models
- scripts to create the plots in the report

## Requirements

All the requirements to run this project can be found in `requirements.txt`.

To install them using pip, run the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Folders and Files

- `baselines`: html files with training results for different target models and different structure encoding methods.
- `code`
  - `code/data_scraping`:
    - julia scripts for launching simulations
  - `code/data_preprocessing`: scripts to preprocess the data
    - julia scripts
      - parse simulation results to json files
    - python scripts
      - parse simulation results in json files to one csv file `data/data.csv`
  - `code/eda`
    - notebooks for exploratory data analysis
  - `code/tools`: toolbox containing base methods for data preprocessing, model training and evaluation
    - `code/tools/encoding_periodic_table.ipynb`: generate `code/tools/periodic_table_info.json` file containing information about the periodic table and used in some encoding methods
    - `code/tools/data_loader.py`: methods to load data from `data/data.csv`
  - `code/sandbox`: notebooks for testing new ideas and debugging
  - `code/regression`: scripts training, evaluating and saving models for the different regression targets defined for this project.
  - `code/classification`: scripts training, evaluating and saving models for $\Delta E$ classification target (order of magnitude).
  - `code/hyperparameter_tuning`: scripts for hyperparameter tuning for the different models. Use RandomizedSearchCV from the sklearn library to find the best hyperparameters for the different targets. Note that a standard machine might not be able to handle the computational effort of many iterations.
  - `code/model_analysis`: notebooks for analyzing the predictions of the different models.
    - `code/model_analysis/baseline_analysis.ipynb`: analysis of the predictions of the different regression models.
    - `code/model_analysis/classification_decision_boundaries.ipynb`: generate figures displaying the decision boundaries of the $\Delta E$ classifer.
  - `code/optimization`: contains a script implementing the simulation parameter optimization procedure described in the report.
- `data`: contains all the data files. In this folder you may find subfolders with the name of structures which contain simulation results. You may also find 3 csv files:
  - `data/data.csv`: contains the data used for the project. This dataset is built using all the data from the structure folders.
  - `data/ref_energy.csv`: contains the reference energy for each structure.
- `models`: folder in which models trained are saved (python scripts from `code/regression` save their models in this folder).
- `plots`: some plots are saved here.
